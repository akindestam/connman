================

Service		org.moblin.connman
Interface	org.moblin.connman.Device
Object path	[variable prefix]/{device0,device1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns properties for the device object. See
			the properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as read-write are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InvalidProperty

		void ProposeScan()

			Proposes to trigger a scan transaction.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

Signals		PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string Address [readonly]

			The address of the device.

		string Name [readonly]

			The device name (for example "Wireless" etc.)

			This name can be used for directly displaying it in
			the application. It has pure informational purpose
			and there is not guarantee that it is present.

		string Type [readonly]

			The device type (for example "ethernet", "wifi" etc.)

		string Interface [readonly]

			The device interface (for example "eth0" etc.)

			This value is for pure informational purposes. It
			is not guaranteed that it is always present.

		boolean Powered [readwrite]

			Switch a device on or off. This will also modify
			the list of networks in range. All known networks
			will be still available via the Networks property.

			Changing this value doesn't change the value of the
			Policy property.

			The value of this property can be changed by other
			parts of the system (including the kernel). An
			example would be modifications via the "ifconfig"
			command line utility.

		boolean Blocked [readonly]

			Indicates if a device transmission capability is
			blocked or not. This property is a translation of
			the device rfkill status. If it is hard or soft
			blocked, this property will be true.

			Once a device is blocked, enabling it will fail.

		uint16 ScanInterval [readwrite]

			The scan interval describes the time in seconds
			between automated scan attempts. Setting this
			value to 0 will disable the background scanning.

			The default value is 300 and so every 5 minutes
			a scan procedure will be triggered.

			This property is not available with all types
			of devices. Some might not support background
			scanning at all.

		boolean Scanning [readonly]

			Indicates if a device is scanning. Not all device
			types might support this. Also some hardware might
			execute background scanning without notifying the
			driver about it. Use this property only for visual
			indication.

		array{object} Networks [readonly]

			List of networks objects paths. Every object path
			represents a network in range or a known network.
